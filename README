== About ==
Minecraft mod for simple plugin loading and sharing.

== Note for developers ==
You have to decompile minecraft yourself (using the Minecraft Coder Pack MCP)
and copy all minecraft sources to "src/minecraft_original/net/minecraft/client" and
"src/minecraft_original/net/minecraft/src".

For committing create the minecraft source files patch ("src/mc.patch") with
the scripts "makepatch.bat" or "makepatch.sh".
NEVER commit any original or modified minecraft files. Only commit the created
patch file which contains the changes.

After every GIT PULL execute "applypatch.bat" or "applypatch.sh" in the src/
directory, so you receive the latest changes on all the original minecraft
files.

== Note for plugin developers ==
Please wait until the official API and Wiki is released.
